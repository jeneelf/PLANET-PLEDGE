# PLANET-PLEDGE
Welcome to Planet Pledge source code. This is an app that started as an idea between Jeneel, Ibukun and Ivan during the Morgan State Hackathon. PlanetPledge is an app that tracks sustainable actions and rewards users with NFTs via XRP Ledger. Users can track actions such as reducing their carbon footprint, volunteering for environmental organizations, and using public transport. The platform aims to create a global community of environmentally conscious individuals who are taking action to protect our planet.
